The goal of this lab is to read in a ``tweet'' string and parse it into smaller
strings based on hashtag delimiters then print out the parsed strings nicely.
The Scanner class will be utilized, as well as several String methods. A 
pseudocode follows:

input: tweet
constants: N/A
do: parsedTweet = tweet.split(<delimiters>)
do: formatTweet = parsedTweet.replace(',','-').replace(';',' ');
output: nicely formated strings!
