The goal of this lab is to read in a message string and parse it into smaller
strings based on a whitespace delimiter then print out the parsed strings nicely.
The Scanner class will be utilized, as well as several String methods such as
.next(), .nextDouble, and .equalsIgnoreCase(). Additionally the code will classify 
the type of message by using if, else if, else statements.
