Lab 9 Brainstorm

The goal of this lab is to understand the basics behind OOP. To do this
a template file Circle.java is given, which is a circle class with
several incomplete methods. In this lab, we will complete these methods
with the proper inputs and return statements. These methods includes
mutators and accessors to change and retrieve values of the circle objects.
Once the class is complete, the CircleTester.java file will be edited and
run to test if the various methods work with two different circle variables.
