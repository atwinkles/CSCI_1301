Lab 7 Brainstorm

The goal of this lab is to write software that will ask for a string, then give
various options to the user on how the string can be manipulated. The user will
choose an option, and if the choice is valid the program will return the proper
result. This lab will utilize while and for loops, as well as basic string 
methods.
