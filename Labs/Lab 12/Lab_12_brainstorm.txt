Lab 12 Brainstorm

The goal of this lab is to develop an entire class consisting of 
constructors, accessors, mutators, and useful methods on our own. 
A key aspect of this lab is the consideration of memory differences
between primative types and class types such as arrays - ie to properly
set and get the data for the Stat class, a new array must be constructed
rather than referencing an existing one, so that if said existing array
is altered, it does not necessarily alter that of the Stat class instance.
Beyond this consideration, methods will be created that check if two 
instances are equal, compute the average of the data, and find the mode of 
the data. For the mode (arguably the most complicated method), a new array
will be created that will count the occurances of each number in each 
position. This array will then be analyzed to find the position of the
number that occurs most frequently. If there are more than one,
the method will return Nan.
