Lab 8 Brainstorm

Alexander Winkles

Members: (was out sick)

The goal of this lab is to implement a program that generates two 1D arrays
based on the equation y = 20.0*|sinx|. The program will use the Scanner 
class to prompt the user for three values: N, xmin, and xstep. N is the 
size of the array, xmin is the minimum x value, and xstep is the increment
of x. If the user inputs a negative N, the program will display an error
and exit. After all x and y values are computed, a simple graph is displayed
using asterisks. 

pseudocode:

N = keyboard.nextInt();
xmin = keyboard.nextDouble();
xstep = keyboard.nextDouble();

double[] x = new double[N];
double[] y = new double[N];

x[0] = xmin;

for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
x[i] = x[i-1] + xstep;
}
for (int i = 0; i<N; i++) {
y[i] = 20.0*Math.abs(Math.sin(x));
}

for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = (int)(y[i]); j >= 0; j--) {
        System.out.print("*");
    }
}
