Lab 6 Brainstorm

The goal of this lab is to read in a natural number and check whether it is 
a palindrome or not. If anything besides a natural number is given, an error
will be returned. To check if the number is a palindrome or not, modulus will
be used as well as Math.log10 and Math.pow. The Scanner class is used to take
in the original natural number.
