Lab 2 Brainstorm

The goal of this lab is to compute a person's gross and net pay based on 
hourly wages, hours worked, and withholdings. To accomplish this,
constants outlined in the lab will be declared outside of the main
method. To compute gross pay, the code will utilize the Scanner class
to find how many hours the user worked and will assign their input to
hoursPerWeek. Then the code will compute hoursPerWeek*PAY_PER_HOUR to find
the gross pay. Each tax deduction will then be calculated and assigned to 
their respective variables. The sum of these taxes will then be subtracted
from the gross pay to find the net pay. All the results will be printed 
nicely as outlined by the lab instructions. A pseudocode follows:

input: hoursPerWeek
constants: FEDERAL_TAX_PERCENT, STATE_TAX_PERCENT, SS_PERCENT,
            MEDICARE_PERCENT, PAY_PER_HOUR
do: grossPay = hoursPerWeek*PAY_PER_HOUR
do: fedTax = FEDERAL_TAX_PERCENT*grossPay 
do: stateTax = STATE_TAX_PERCENT*grossPay 
do: medicare = MEDICARE_PERCENT*grossPay
do: ss = SS_PERCENT*grossPay
do: netPay = grossPay - (fedTax+stateTax+medicare+ss)
return: grossPay, netPay, fedTax, stateTax, medicare, ss
